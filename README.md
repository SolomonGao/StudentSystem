# Overview

This project is a school management system.Right now it could allow user read students' and instructors' information from a file and add, delete, or edit them and
save them into that file. It also allow user to add and drop courses, which stored in another file, to the students and instructors. It also has the function to sort
the data. This project is mainly for demonstrating my skills in C++ language.

I wrote this project with the skills of function, class, operator, inheritance, polymorphism, pointers, the useage of heap space, container(vector), quick sort, reading
and writing to a file.  This software is well functional and in good C++ format.
